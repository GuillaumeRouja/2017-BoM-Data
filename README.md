# 2017-BoM-Data

After completing a data scientist professional certificate with IBM and Coursera I wanted to work with real datasets and start a project on my own from data collection and aggregation to the end result so this is the resulting experience of weather data aggregation and cleaning.

It is about combining a number of data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology(BoM) in order to present an hourly average, min, max temperatures and precipitations for a given weather station in Australia.

It seemed important to clean and organize these data as the original format did not allow any analysis. Indeed, the raw data are a combination of 730 csv files (one for each day from 20160501 to 20180430), each containing approximately 48,000 rows so a total of about 34,000,000 rows to aggregate.
